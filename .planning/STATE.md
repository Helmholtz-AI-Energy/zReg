# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-08 after v1.4 milestone)

**Core value:** Every existing capability works correctly, fails informatively, and is covered by tests.
**Current focus:** Phase 44 — cpd-weighted-label-transfer-method

## Current Position

Phase: 44 (cpd-weighted-label-transfer-method) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 4
Milestone: v1.4 Trajectory Alignment & Optimization Enhancements — **ARCHIVED** 2026-07-08
Tests: 1204 passed, 18 skipped, 1 xpassed
Next action: Execute 44-04-PLAN.md (EvaluationRunner align_result threading)

## v1.4 Milestones (In Progress)

| Phase | Name | Plans | Status |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| 39 | ICP Registration as CPD Alternative | 2 | ✅ Completed |
| 40 | Sliced Wasserstein Variants as Alignment | 4 | ✅ Completed |
| 41 | Alignment Preprocessing (PCA + Velocity) | 2 | ✅ Completed |
| 42 | Sobol Quasi-Random Search as Default | 2 | ✅ Completed |
| 43 | Per-Trajectory Data Standardization | 1 | ✅ Completed |

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 44 added: CPD-Weighted Label Transfer Method — wire zreg.color_transfer's existing CPD_WEIGHTED method into LabelTransferStage as an alternative to the hardcoded KNN_VOTING, mirroring the alignment_method optional-param precedent from Phase 39. Added outside a formal milestone (v1.4 archived, v1.5 not yet started) at user request.

### v1.4 Design Decisions

- **ICP**: Wrap Open3D (point-to-point) as registration method
- **SWD**: Leverage existing zReg Sliced Wasserstein variants (SWD, ASWD, OSWD, GSWD, PSWD, MaxSWD)
- **Preprocessing**: Principal axes alignment + velocity landmark detection
- **Sobol**: Default search strategy (grid search as fallback)
- **Standardization**: Default data preprocessing (normalization as optional)
- **Execution**: All 5 phases independent → can run in parallel

### Requirements

See: `.planning/REQUIREMENTS-v1.4.md`

- ALIGN-04: ICP integration (5 requirements)
- ALIGN-05: SWD variants (5 requirements)
- ALIGN-06: Preprocessing (5 requirements)
- OPT-04: Sobol search (6 requirements)
- DATA-02: Standardization (7 requirements)

### Open Blockers

None — Plan 44-03 complete; Plan 44-04 ready for execution.

### Performance Metrics

| Phase | Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|
| 44 | 01 | 33min | 2 | 3 |
| 44 | 02 | 25min | 2 | 2 |
| 44 | 03 | 24min | 2 | 2 |

### Deferred Items (acknowledged at v1.2 close)

| Category | Item | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| verification | Phase 26 SC-4 — live `mpirun -n 2` Propulate integration | Unverified (missing GPy in dev env; Optuna path unaffected) |
| nyquist | 14 of 27 phases without VALIDATION.md | Backfill optional via `/gsd:validate-phase N` |
| metadata | Empty `requirements-completed` SUMMARY frontmatter on most phases | Coverage confirmed via VERIFICATION evidence tables |
| code-review | Open CR/WR items (matplotlib Agg backend leak; `subprocess.run` timeout in `trajectory.py`; `eval/` excluded from `--cov`) | Non-blocking; track in next milestone |
